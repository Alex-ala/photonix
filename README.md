# photo-manager

Photo management application based on web technologies.

This project is currently in early stages. I have a lot of thoughts on how I want photo management and viewing to work. I'm on the way to an MVP and it's shaping up nicely so stay tuned... also please suggest a name for this thing! :)

The easiest way to try it out is with docker-compose (though there are currently no pre-built images so it will take a while to download and build).

```
git clone git@github.com:damianmoore/photo-manager.git
cd photo-manager/
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

A few seconds after starting you should be able to go to [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/) in your browser.
